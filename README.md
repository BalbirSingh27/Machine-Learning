## 📂 Notebooks Included

### 1. 🔍 Data Exploration & Descriptive Statistics
**Objective:** Understand the dataset structure, missing values, and initial data distributions.

- Explored data types, null values, outliers
- Used visualizations (histograms, boxplots) for univariate analysis
- Conducted basic statistical profiling (mean, median, skewness)
- Gained initial insights to guide later feature engineering

---

### 2. 📊 Data Visualization & Feature Analysis
**Objective:** Identify relationships between features and detect influential predictors.

- Created pairplots, heatmaps, violin and scatter plots
- Analyzed feature correlations and interactions
- Detected multicollinearity and class imbalance (if applicable)
- Identified strong vs. weak predictors for modeling

---

### 3. 📈 Predictive Modeling using Linear Regression
**Objective:** Build a regression model to predict a continuous outcome.

- Built linear regression models using scikit-learn
- Used train/test split to avoid overfitting
- Evaluated model performance with RMSE, MAE, and R²
- Interpreted model coefficients and residual behavior

---

### 4. 🧠 Classification Modeling & Evaluation
**Objective:** Apply classification algorithms and compare their performance.

- Implemented models like Logistic Regression, KNN, or Decision Trees
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
- Plotted Confusion Matrix and ROC Curves
- Discussed results and model selection trade-offs
